- `background.js` – Core tab-monitoring logic  
- `popup.html`, `popup.js`, `popup.css` – UI for activation, bookmarking

## 🎯 Purpose & Vision

This repo is a snapshot of experiments and learning milestones. Some projects are complete prototypes, others are early-stage ideas. They track growth—from quick web prototypes to paid-ready extensions—reflecting design, logic, testing, and iteration in code.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps / Tips

- *StayOnSite* has since moved to a dedicated repo and is now feature-rich and published.
- Small projects like the Valentine page remain as reference for design/play.
- Feel free to fork or explore — these are open to experimentation or reuse.
